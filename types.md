## Reading Group

The primary goal of a reading group project is to understand a given model, theory, or concept by working through a specific book. 

## Distillation

The primary goal of a distillation project is to make it easier for subsequent generations to undertand a specific concept. 
Formulated more abstractly, a distillation project aims to reduce [research debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/). <br><br>

Participants should have some rough understanding of the general ideas surrounding the concept. For example, the participants of 
a project on Noether's theorem should have some rudiemntary understanding of the Lagrangian formulation and Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics. <br><br>

The deliverable is typically a pdf file that summarizes the learnings and results gathered during the project. 

## Research Projects

The  primary goal of a research project is to discover previously-unknown truths.
