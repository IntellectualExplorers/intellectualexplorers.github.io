**What does an expedition cost?**

Fees are determined individually by each guide and are discussed in the initial meeting.

**Will all learning materials be provided by the guide?**

While in some cases this can be the case, typically participants have to buy the relevant textbooks themselves.

**Are group expeditions possible?**

Sure. Simply reach out to the guide you want to hire and tell him or her about your idea.
