A solid understanding of classical mechanics is essential for anyone interested in physics. The goal of this expedition is to become familiar with all the fundamental concepts and equations that are commonly used in classical mechanics. We will do this by going through the book "No-Nonsense Classical Mechanics" chapter by chapter.
