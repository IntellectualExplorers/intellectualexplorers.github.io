## Description

**Starting Date:** {{ page.dat }}

**Organized by:** {{ page.organizator }}

The goal is to understand the key ideas behind gauge theories by using a toy version of a financial market. Such a market also has a gauge symmetry and is therefore ideally suited to discuss all important concepts like gauge connections, internal spaces, and curvature in an intuitve context.
