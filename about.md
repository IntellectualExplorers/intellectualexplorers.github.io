## What?







## How?



## Why?


In the current academic system an incredibly large talent pool is locked out from participating. The only way to learn intellectually challenging topics seems to be to enroll for years as a full time student at a university. The only way to contribute to the solutions of open questions seems to be to hold an academic position. But how many people have time and money for full time studies? How many academic positions are there and who has a realistic chance of getting one of them? 

To make matters even worse, interesting projects never get picked up because they are not the kind of thing you can get funding for. The current funding structures favor monocultures since in order to [rake up citations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01204) you must publish papers on topics that attract many papers by other researchers. <br><br>


Important contributes like the reduction of [research debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) are not valued at all and even considered a waste of time. As a result, a lot of implicit knowledge in the world is still not readily available. In addition, there is no funding for [risky research](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1996476) and thus most researchers only carry out incremental, planable research. As much as this may sound like bad news, it's also a reason to be optimistic because the neglect by professional researchers means that outsiders have a real chance of contributing something meaningful. <br><br>

Another root cause for the [diminishing returns in science](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/) is that "[traditionally taught science and mathematics teach little except obedience](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0512202)". Since no one is trying to reduce research debt and the teaching methods are so antiquated, most disciplines have failed to "[build a portal for most people to even understand what the issues are, what are the objects, what is the game?](http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/eric-weinstein-2)" <br><br>

Motivated by these observations, we want to provide an alternative framework that allows anyone to participate, to learn, and to discover [previously-unknown truths](https://meaningness.com/metablog/upgrade-your-cargo-cult).
