## What?


Think of knowledge as something like a continent. What’s the best way to become familiar with a region that sparked your interest?

- A video lecture course is like a travel documentary. Maybe entertaining but won’t provide you with any deep understanding. 
- A traditional university course is like a bus tour. Everyone travels to the same famous landmarks and only hears the same explanations irrespective of their personal interests and background.
- A completely independent "backpacking tour" through the continent of knowledge can be an intimidating endeavour and those who try it often get stuck or lost.

Isn’t there any other alternative? There is. Think of it as guided expeditions through the continent of knowledge.

- The program of an expedition is as flexible as in an independent "backpacking tour" but you still have an experienced guide at your side that makes sure you won’t get stuck or lost.
- You'll still have to wade through the mud yourself but the guide will support you and move major obstacles out of your way.

There are no fixed rules but typically an expedition works as follows:

- During an initial virtual meeting, the guide and participant clarify the goals of the expedition and outline a program in broad strokes.
- The guide then suggest learning material (book chapters, etc.) which the participant studies independently. 
- Regularly (typically weekly), there is a virtual meeting in which the guide and participant discuss the progress, solve problems, and plan the next steps together.
- In addition, between meetings the participant gets help from the guide asynchronously.

Currently existing modes of learning do not work well for most people and despite of all the opportunities created by the internet, there hasn't been a real revolution in education.

- Traditional university courses ignore individual needs, often focus more on grades than understanding, and are not available to everyone. In the current academic system an incredibly large talent pool is locked out from participating. 
- Existing online education frameworks are readily accessible but don’t provide everything that is necessary for a successful learning experience. Most of them focus solely on providing content but ignore that accountability, support, and guidance are equally if not more important.

In contrast, our expeditions focus on helping you understand, are open to everyone, and provide a framework that makes sure that all puzzle pieces that are necessary for successful learning experiences are in place.
