I provide customized direct instruction and guide inquiry-based learning in a variety of subjects related to math and physics. Some examples of subjects I've taught appear below, but I am always happy to create a new syllabus for a student, whenever my expertise allows for it.

Most of my students are professionals looking to expand their knowledge in a setting that is more flexible and personalized than a college course. I've taught people with Ivy League math degrees, and people with little to no previous math background. I've taught engineers at Google Brain, OpenAI, and Facebook.

## Testimonials

"I’ve immensely enjoyed working with Mark over the past year to learn category theory and connect it with mental models of my own field. Mark does an excellent job of prioritizing learning: I chose a set of goal papers and topics to understand, and he helped determine and learn the necessary background. He was also able to dive into recent papers and break them down to help build my own understanding. Along the way, he was open to experimenting with different teaching styles to determine what worked best for me. Additionally, working with Mark logistically has been great, as he is flexible around scheduling conflicts with some warning."

"Just had Mark Moon teach me some basic category theory in preparation for learning Lawvere's theorem. It was absolutely awesome. Mark is a great teacher, and I have high standards. If you are interested in learning category theory or anything else Mark can teach, I strongly recommend booking him."
