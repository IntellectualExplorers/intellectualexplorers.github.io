I provide customized direct instruction and guide inquiry-based learning in a variety of subjects related to math and physics. Some examples of subjects I've taught appear below, but I am always happy to create a new syllabus for a student, whenever my expertise allows for it.

Most of my students are professionals looking to expand their knowledge in a setting that is more flexible and personalized than a college course. I've taught people with Ivy League math degrees, and people with little to no previous math background. I've taught engineers at Google Brain, OpenAI, and Facebook.
