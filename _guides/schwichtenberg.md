I love making sense of something difficult, breaking it down into understandable pieces, and then teaching it to others.

The main idea behind my teaching style is perfectly summarized by the following quote by Edwin Jaynes:

*"The goal should be, not to implant in the studentsâ€™ mind every fact that the teacher knows now; but rather to implant a way of thinking that enables the student, in the future, to learn in one year what the teacher learned in two years. Only in that way can we continue to advance from one generation to the next."*
